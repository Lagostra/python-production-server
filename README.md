# Python Production Server

A package that allows easy hosting of Python functions as REST API endpoints with a schema similar to the one used by
MATLAB Production Server. It is meant to be able to function as a drop-in replacement for the MATLAB Production Server Web API, 
allowing software that relies on this API to execute Python code with no modifications.
