# Python Production Server

A package that allows easy hosting of Python functions as REST API endpoints with a schema similar to the one used by
MATLAB Production Server. It is meant to be able to function as a drop-in replacement for MATLAB Production Server, 
allowing software that relies on MATLAB to execute Python code with no modifications.
